# Feed Reader Project

This is my version of the Feed Reader Project. I made use use of the Jasmine Testing framework to implement the tests detailed in the project's instruction to recreate the feed reader application with tests.

## Run the app

To run the application simply load the project's folder on a localhost and open the index.html file.

## Gulp and Sass

I have implemented *Sass* to concatenate and minify the 3 CSS files in the project using *Gulp* tasks, that's why I only included the style.css file that contains the result of the concatenated and minified css files. I have also minified and included the minified version of the app in the project (_app.min.js_).

### Note

I have ignored the node_modules directory in my .gitignore file to reduce the size of the directory.
